# Thud Challenge

## The Game

Implementation of the game Thud, from Terry Pratchett's novel, Thud!

The endgame here is to create a code challenge to play either the Dwarf or Troll side
of the game the most successfully.

## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AJFaraday/Thud.git
cd Thud
npm install
```

You can then open /dist/index.html in your browser.

## Modification

Any changes to the code should be made in the src directory, and can be built for use
by running:

```shell
npm run build
```
