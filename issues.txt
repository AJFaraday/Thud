Issues to resolve:

* Merge Troll and Dwarf classes, just have Piece.
* Add indexed_dwarves and indexed_trolls to controller interface (index remains static, could return null)
* ControllerHelper.moves_for should return kills for each space
* Get moves for one of the other side's pieces in controller (have a think)
* Update interface docs
* Should `wrapper` be in ControlerHelper?

Long term thinking:
* Unit test suite
* Couple of test clients
* Tournament runner
* Import script
