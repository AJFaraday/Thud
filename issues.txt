Must:

Could:

* Show better errors from validator? (can we get a line no?)
* Use local storage to keep the client selections
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* Progress bar (text turn/limit)

Won't (but it would be nice if I did):
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)
