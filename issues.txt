Issues to resolve:

* Reverse direction_calculator. To record which moves are dangerous.
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Update interface docs
* could anything else have is_dwarf() and is_troll() methods? - Controller? Client?

Long term thinking:
* Write up challenge, put it on sandbox
* Couple of test clients
* Tournament runner
* Import script
