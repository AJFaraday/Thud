Issues to resolve:

* Reverse direction_calculator. To record which moves are dangerous.
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Update interface docs
* add `is_dwarf()` and `is_troll()` to both space and piece, simplify code wherever we `see == 'd'`.

Long term thinking:
* Unit test suite
* Couple of test clients
* Tournament runner
* Import script
