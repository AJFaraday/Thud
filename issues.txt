Must:

* Present the result of the tournament as JSON (to dispaly on question)
* Create page of leaderboards (all, dwarf and troll)
* Create page of matches (Filter by client)
* * turn
* * score
* * Completion time

Could:

* Use local storage to keep the client selections
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* Progress bar (text turn/limit)

Won't (but it would be nice if I did):
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)
