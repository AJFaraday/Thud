Issues to resolve:

* troll can be shoved onto another troll. Not great.
* only show Edit link for non-inert clients
* Don't show dummy clients, only manual.
* Controller Utils class
** Distance between (currently in Utils)
** Move towards
* Reverse direction_calculator. To record which moves are dangerous.
* Change canvas reporter - kills always red, dangerous spaces always orange

Nice to haves:
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)

Long term thinking:
* Write up challenge, put it on sandbox
* Code validator (used on edit and import)
** Code evaluates
** Doesn't include forbidden terms (game, rand...)
** Defines a class
** Class can finish play a game against a default client (every turn has a move)
*** This feels heavyweight, but seems to take milliseconds
* moar test clients
* protect against games halting
** Mechanism to disqualify if a turn finishes without a move.
** Only if they are in the inert group, we don't enforce this.
** Maybe functions: player_name
* Tournament runner
* Import script
