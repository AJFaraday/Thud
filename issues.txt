Issues to resolve:


* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* could anything else have is_dwarf() and is_troll() methods? - Controller? Client?
* Stop passing game into client classes
* troll can be shoved onto another troll. Not great.
* Controller Utils class
** Distance between (currently in Utils)
** Move towards
* Reverse direction_calculator. To record which moves are dangerous.
* Change canvas reporter - kills always red, dangerous spaces always orange

Long term thinking:
* Write up challenge, put it on sandbox
* moar test clients
* protect against games halting
** Mechanism to disqualify if a turn finishes without a move.
** Some way to mark clients (e.g. manual and dummy) which bypass this.
* UI to customise game
** which clients
** speed
** modify code?!?
* Tournament runner
* Import script
