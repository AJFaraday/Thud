Issues to resolve:

* Use local storage to keep the client selections?
* Add validations for turn and end_turn functions
* More forbidden terms
** setTimeout
** setInterval
* Revisit troll moves (can not move onto another piece)
* More info about space_info (what are the things?)
* in_danger (and safe_moves) don't include moves which are safe after killing the things (for dwarves)
* add single in_danger attribute to space_info

Nice to haves:
* Progress bar (text turn/limit)
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)

Long term thinking:
* Tournament runner
* Import script

Tournament runner:
* Collect all clients (both sides)
*
