Issues to resolve:

* add single in_danger attribute to space_info


Nice to haves:
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* Use local storage to keep the client selections?
* Progress bar (text turn/limit)
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)
