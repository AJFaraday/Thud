Issues to resolve:

* Add end-game (at least report score and reason)
* Use private instance field to lock down Controller
* Should Board.spaces be a function?
* Merge Troll and Dwarf classes, just have Piece.
* Add indexed_dwarves and indexed_trolls to controller interface (index remains static, could return null)
* ControllerHelper.moves_for should return kills for each space
* Get moves for one of the other side's pieces in controller (have a think)
* Update interface docs
