Issues to resolve:


* Use local storage to keep the client selections?
* troll can be shoved onto another troll. Not great.
* dwarf can be hurled over a troll into another troll... is that allowed?
* only the dwarf on the end of the row can be hurled. (currently, others can)
* In `space_info`, include `in_danger` boolean for moves. - for trolls
* Also include `safe_moves` to `space_info` (reject all in_danger) - for trolls
* Change canvas reporter - kills always red, dangerous spaces always orange
* Add validations for turn and end_turn functions
* More forbidden terms
** setTimeout
** setInterval
* Revisit troll moves (can not move onto a dwarf)
* More info about space_info (what are the things?

Nice to haves:
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)

Long term thinking:
* moar test clients
* Tournament runner
* Import script
