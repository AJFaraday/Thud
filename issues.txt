Issues to resolve:

* change check_space to return space info (change manual.js to use `moves`
* Saving a client sets the select for that player back to 'manual'
** Use local storage to keep the client selections?
* Add validations for turn and end_turn functions
* Save on modal should be "Apply"
* troll can be shoved onto another troll. Not great.
* only show Edit link for non-inert clients
* Don't show dummy clients, only manual.
* Controller Utils class
** Move towards
** farthest_from(moves, target) - moves = [{x:1,y:1}...] - target = {x:1, y:1}
* Update `check_space` to use `space_info` (manual.js will need updating)
* In `space_info`, include `in_danger` boolean for moves.
* Change canvas reporter - kills always red, dangerous spaces always orange

More forbidden terms
* setTimeout
* setInterval

Nice to haves:
* Codemirror or similar plugin on code editing
* convenience method to combine select_space and move
* Standard way to respond to either (x, y) or ({x: x, y: y}) (lots of places could use this)

Long term thinking:
* moar test clients
* Tournament runner
* Import script
