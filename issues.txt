Issues to resolve:

* Update interface docs
* controller.check_move can be simplified now (move_calculator tell you of kills)
* game.previous_move is always it's initial value
* convenience method to combine select_space and move

Long term thinking:
* Unit test suite
* Couple of test clients
* Tournament runner
* Import script
